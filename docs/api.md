# Extending GEF #

`GEF` intends to provide a battery-included, quickly installable and crazy fast
debugging environment sitting on top of GDB.

But it most importantly provides all the primitives for letting hackers create
their own commands rapidly. Also this page intends to summarize how to create in
2 seconds advanced GDB commands using `GEF` as a library.

_Side note_: [Other projects](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) accuses `GEF` to
not be easily hackable for new features. This documentation also aims to prove
them wrong.

A [dedicated repository](https://github.com/hugsy/gef-scripts) was born to host
external scripts. This repo is open to all for contributions, no 
restrictions and the most valuable ones will be integrated into `gef.py`.

## Quick start ##

Here is the most basic skeleton for creating a new `GEF` command, named `newcmd`:

```python
class NewCommand(GenericCommand):
    """Dummy one-time command."""
    _cmdline_ = "newcmd"
    _syntax_  = "{:s}".format(_cmdline_)

    @only_if_gdb_running               # not required, only checks if the debug session is started
    def do_invoke(self, argv):
    # do whatever things allowed by gef, for example show the current running
    # architecture as Python object:
    print(" = {}".format(current_arch) )
    # or showing the current $pc
    print("pc = {:#x}".format(current_arch.pc))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    register_external_command( NewCommand() )
```

Yes, that's it!

Loading it by `GEF` is as easy as
```
gef➤  source /path/to/newcmd.py
[+] Loading 'NewCommand'
```

We can call it:

## Detailed explainations ##

Our new command must be a class that inherits from GEF's `GenericCommand`. The
*only* requirements are:

 * that the new class must declare a `_cmdline_` variable (the command to type
   on GDB)
 * a `_syntax_` variable, which GEF will use to auto-generate the help menu
 * a method `do_invoke(args)` which is the code to be executed when the command
   is typed. `args` is an array of string with the arguments passed from command
   line

Last, we make GEF aware of this new command by registering it in the `__main__`
section of the script, by invoking the global function
`register_external_command()`.

From then, you have a working new GEF command, which you can load, either from
cli:
```
gef➤  source /path/to/newcmd.py
```
or add to your `~/.gdbinit`:
```
$ echo source /path/to/newcmd.py >> ~/.gdbinit
```

## API ##

Some of the most important API when creating new commands are mentioned (but not
limited to) below. To see the full help of a function, open GDB and GEF, and use
the embedded Python interpreter's `help` command. For example:

```
gef➤  python-interactive help(Architecture)
```

or even from outside GDB:

```
$ gdb -q -ex 'pi help(hexdump)' -ex quit
```


### Globals ###

```
current_arch
```
> Global variable associated with the architecture of the currently debugged
> process. The variable is an instance of the `Architecture` class (see below).

```
read_memory(addr, length=0x10)
```
> Returns a `length` long byte array with the copy of the process memory at
> `addr`.

```
write_memory(address, buffer, length=0x10)
```
> Writes `buffer` at address `address`.


```
read_int_from_memory(addr)
```
> Reads the size of an integer from `addr`, and unpacks it correctly (based on endianess)

```
read_cstring_from_memory(address)
```
> Return a NULL-terminated array of bytes, from `addr`.


```
get_register(register_name)
```
> Returns the value of given register.


```
get_process_maps()
```
> Returns an array of Section objects (see below) corresponding to the current
> memory layout of the process.


```
gef_disassemble(addr, nb_insn, from_top=False)
```
> Disassemble `nb_insn` instructions after `addr`. If `from_top` is False
> (default), it will also disassemble the `nb_insn` instructions before `addr`.
> Return an iterator of Instruction objects (see below).



### Decorators ###

```
@only_if_gdb_running
```
> Checks if a GDB session is running, if not return. A GDB session is running is
>
> * a PID exists for the targeted binary
> * GDB is running on a coredump of a binary


```
@only_if_gdb_target_local
```
> Checks if the current GDB session is local i.e. not debugging using GDB
> `remote`.



### Classes ###

For exhaustive documentation, run
```
$ gdb -q -ex 'pi help(<ClassName>)' -ex quit
```
